---

### Task 3 – Process time to hour, day, month, is_weekend, weekday
Create hour, day, month, is_weekend, weekday feature

---


### Task 4 – Define target for driver cancellation and check its distribution


---

### Task 5 – EDA for Customer Cancellations

- Showing Cancellation Rate by Vehicle Type, Cancellation Rate by Hour, Cancellation Rate by Day of Week

---

### Task 6 – Feature Engineering

- One-hot Encoding Vehicle Type

- Replace NaNs in numeric columns with placeholder

- Drop columns not needed for modeling

---

### Task 7 – Balance Class Weights
Balancing the class weights before putting it into model to advoid model tend to becoming bias to one class

---

### Task 8 – Model Prediction and Evaluation
Using at least 3 models to predict the result and give the evaluation

---
