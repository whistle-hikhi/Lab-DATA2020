# DATA2010 - Data Science Programming - Autumn 2025

## Course Objections
This course covers the major programming tools used in Data Science. This includes libraries within Python and the R programming language. Python libraries include those used in data preprocessing, managing data tables and data pipelines, dataflow programming on GPUs, visualisation and scientific computing. Some R counterparts to these are covered. Major components of the R development environment are also taught including documentation and external integration.

## Installation
For python programming, you can use notebooks in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [GoogleCollab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to your computer

For R programmming:
- Download R from the [CRAN repository](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Download RStudio from the [RStudio Download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
